# Dynamic Bookmarks!

## Why?
Every week at work I have to change the Confluence bookmark of the project's weekly table. I don't want to do that, I want to automate it.

## What?
I want an addon that periodically changes a bookmark's URL given a rule. This rule is generally a number that changes over time. The user can set this rule as a matematical operation.

## How?
I have no idea, I've never written an addon! I'm going to follow some tutorials & this [example](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/blob/main/bookmark-it/background.js)
